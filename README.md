It's a project for Ragam induction. I use react frame work for this project and for UI/UX I use the figma file that given by induction committee. 
For the animation part I used Framer-motion and simple CSS animations.
I used react-routing to switch the pages on run time.
I deployed it on Vercel.
Overall it was an amazing experience for me , I learned lots of things by this project.
