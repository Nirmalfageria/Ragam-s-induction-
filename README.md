It's a project for Ragam induction. I use **react fram**e work for this project and for UI/UX I use the figma file that given by induction committee. 
For the animation part I used **Framer-motion** and simple CSS animations.
I used** react-routing** to switch the pages on run time.
I tried to** deploy it on Github pages **but I got some errors I tried to fix them but I can not able fix them but yeah I still trying to fix them.
Overall it was an amazing experience for me , I learned lots of things by this project.
